#### üìå Certificate Types in Kubernetes

| Certificate                    | Purpose                                             | Signed By        | Default Validity |   TYPE   |
| ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------- | ---------------- | ---------------- |----------|
| `ca.crt`                       | Cluster Certificate Authority                       | Self-signed      | 10 years         | CA       |
| `etcd-ca.crt`                  | CA for etcd-related certificates                    | Self-signed      | 10 years         | CA       |
| `front-proxy-ca.crt`           | CA for front proxy communication                    | Self-signed      | 10 years         | CA       |
| `apiserver.crt`                | TLS certificate for Kubernetes API Server           | `ca`             | 1 year           | component|
| `apiserver-kubelet-client.crt` | Used by API server to authenticate against kubelets | `ca`             | 1 year           | component|
| `apiserver-etcd-client.crt`    | Used by API server to connect securely to etcd      | `etcd-ca`        | 1 year           | component|
| `front-proxy-client.crt`       | Used by API server to communicate with front-proxy  | `front-proxy-ca` | 1 year           | component|
| `etcd-server.crt`              | TLS for etcd server itself                          | `etcd-ca`        | 1 year           | component|
| `etcd-peer.crt`                | etcd peer-to-peer communication                     | `etcd-ca`        | 1 year           | component|
| `etcd-healthcheck-client.crt`  | etcd health check client certificate                | `etcd-ca`        | 1 year           | component|
| `admin.conf`                   | kubeconfig for admin user                           | `ca`             | 1 year           | component|
| `controller-manager.conf`      | kubeconfig for controller manager                   | `ca`             | 1 year           | component|
| `scheduler.conf`               | kubeconfig for scheduler                            | `ca`             | 1 year           | component|

#### üéØ Logical Categories of Kubernetes Certificates

This document summarizes the main Kubernetes certificates, their categories, and how they depend on each other.

---

#### üü¢ 1Ô∏è‚É£ Cluster CA Certificates

These are **root certificates** that sign other certificates in the cluster.

##### ‚úÖ Cluster CA
- **File:** `ca.crt`
- **Signs:**
  - `apiserver.crt`
  - `apiserver-kubelet-client.crt`
  - `admin.conf`
  - `controller-manager.conf`
  - `scheduler.conf`

---

##### ‚úÖ etcd CA
- **File:** `etcd-ca.crt`
- **Signs:**
  - `etcd-server.crt`
  - `etcd-peer.crt`
  - `etcd-healthcheck-client.crt`
  - `apiserver-etcd-client.crt`

---

##### ‚úÖ Front-Proxy CA
- **File:** `front-proxy-ca.crt`
- **Signs:**
  - `front-proxy-client.crt`

> üìù These 3 CAs are **independent roots**, each responsible for a different part of the system.

---

#### üü° 2Ô∏è‚É£ API Server Certificates

Used for securing API server traffic.

- `apiserver.crt` ‚Äì serves HTTPS for API server
- `apiserver-kubelet-client.crt` ‚Äì used by API server to authenticate to kubelet
- `apiserver-etcd-client.crt` ‚Äì used by API server to authenticate to etcd

**Dependencies:**
- `apiserver.crt` depends on `ca.crt`
- `apiserver-kubelet-client.crt` depends on `ca.crt`
- `apiserver-etcd-client.crt` depends on `etcd-ca.crt`

---

#### üü£ 3Ô∏è‚É£ etcd Certificates

Used internally by etcd cluster nodes.

- `etcd-server.crt`
- `etcd-peer.crt`
- `etcd-healthcheck-client.crt`

**Dependency:**
- All signed by `etcd-ca.crt`

---

#### üîµ 4Ô∏è‚É£ Client Kubeconfigs

Certificates embedded in kubeconfigs for admins and controllers.

- `admin.conf`
- `controller-manager.conf`
- `scheduler.conf`

**Dependency:**
- All signed by `ca.crt`

---

#### üü† 5Ô∏è‚É£ Front Proxy Certificates

Used by the API aggregation layer.

- `front-proxy-client.crt`

**Dependency:**
- Signed by `front-proxy-ca.crt`


---

#### ‚è∞ How to check certificates expiration

```bash
kubeadm certs check-expiration
```

Shows expiration of all certs and residual time remaining.

```sh
root@prod-k8-master-node:~# kubeadm certs check-expiration
[check-expiration] Reading configuration from the cluster...
[check-expiration] FYI: You can look at this config file with 'kubectl -n kube-system get cm kubeadm-config -o yaml'

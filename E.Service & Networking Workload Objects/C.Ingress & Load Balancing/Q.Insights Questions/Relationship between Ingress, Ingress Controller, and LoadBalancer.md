# 🕸️ The Relationship Between Ingress, Ingress Controller, and LoadBalancer

## 1. Ingress (Resource)

Defines **rules for routing external traffic (HTTP/HTTPS).**

**Example:**
- `myapp.example.com` → `Service my-app-svc:80`  
- `/api` path → `Service backend-svc:8080`

👉 But **Ingress alone does nothing** — it only declares routing rules.

---

## 2. Ingress Controller (Implementation)

- A **Pod/Deployment** running inside the cluster.  
- Watches for **Ingress resources** and applies the routing rules in a reverse proxy (e.g., **NGINX**, **Traefik**, **HAProxy**).  
- Needs a way for **external traffic** to reach it.

---

## 3. LoadBalancer Service

- In cloud environments (AWS, GCP, Azure), you usually expose the **Ingress Controller** using a **Service of type LoadBalancer**.  
- The **cloud provider provisions an external IP/DNS** and routes traffic to the Ingress Controller Pods.

---

## 🔗 Putting It All Together

1. **Client request** → `https://myapp.example.com`  
2. **LoadBalancer (K8s Service type=LoadBalancer)**  
   - Exposes the Ingress Controller to the outside world.  
   - Cloud provider gives you a public IP or DNS.  
3. **Ingress Controller (e.g., NGINX)**  
   - Receives traffic from the LoadBalancer.  
   - Reads the **Ingress resource rules**.  
   - Routes requests to the appropriate **Service**.  
4. **Kubernetes Service** → Forwards traffic to the correct **Pods (your application)**.

## 🔄 Different Scenarios

### 🌩️ Cloud (AWS / GCP / Azure)
- Ingress Controller is exposed via a **LoadBalancer Service**.  
- The **cloud LoadBalancer** points to Ingress Controller Pods.  
- Ingress resources define how to route traffic.

### 🏠 Bare-metal / On-prem
- No managed LoadBalancer available by default.  
- Use **NodePort** or **MetalLB** to expose the Ingress Controller.  
- Traffic still flows in the same logical path.

## ✅ In Short

| Component | Type | Purpose |
|------------|------|----------|
| **Ingress** | Kubernetes Resource | Defines routing rules (what goes where). |
| **Ingress Controller** | Deployment / Pod | Implements and enforces the rules. |
| **LoadBalancer** | Service Type / External Entity | Exposes the Ingress Controller to the outside world. |

> 🧭 **Analogy:**  
> - *Ingress* = Map (instructions)  
> - *Ingress Controller* = GPS (navigator following the map)  
> - *LoadBalancer* = Highway entrance (entry point to the cluster)

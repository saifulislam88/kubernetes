**What happens to application pods during Kubernetes certificate renewal?**

✅ **Running application pods remain running and continue to serve traffic.**  
Only the control plane (API Server, scheduling, kubectl) experiences brief downtime.

## 🟢 1️⃣ Renewing Only Component Certificates (`kubeadm certs renew all`)

- **Pods:** ✅ Keep running, no impact.
- **API Server:** Short restart (~seconds).
- **Scheduling:** Paused during restart.
- **kubectl:** Brief interruption.

✅ **Recommended and safe.**

## 🟢 2️⃣ Renewing CA Certificates (Same Private Key)

- **Pods:** ✅ Keep running, no impact.
- **API Server:** Restart required to reload CA cert.
- **Kubelet:** Continues trusting existing certs.
- **kubectl:** Short interruption.

✅ **Recommended approach to extend CA expiry.**

---

## 🔴 3️⃣ Rotating CA Certificates (New Private Key)

- **Pods:** ✅ Keep running.
- **API Server:** Offline during cert replacement.
- **Kubelet:** Connections break if not coordinated.
- **kubectl:** Requires updating kubeconfigs.
- **Scheduling:** Blocked until control plane is back.

⚠️ **Use only if the CA is compromised or must be replaced.**

## ✨ Real-World Observations

- 99% of workloads stay running and serve traffic.
- Operators/controllers relying on live API calls may temporarily fail.
- Liveness probes querying the API may fail during restart.

---

## ✅ Best Practice

- Avoid rotating CA private keys unless necessary.
- Renew component certs or CA certs (same key) in maintenance windows.
- In multi-master clusters, rotate one node at a time.

## ✅ Summary Table

| Operation Type                       | Pods         | API Server       | Scheduling      | Client Access         | Recommended              |
|--------------------------------------|--------------|------------------|-----------------|------------------------|--------------------------|
| Component cert renewal               | ✅ Unaffected | ⏸ Short restart  | ⏸ Brief pause   | ⏸ Short interruption   | ✅ Yes                   |
| CA cert renewal (same key)           | ✅ Unaffected | ⏸ Short restart  | ⏸ Brief pause   | ⏸ Short interruption   | ✅ Yes                   |
| CA rotation (new private key)        | ✅ Unaffected | ❌ Offline swap   | ❌ Blocked       | ❌ Must update configs  | ⚠️ Only if necessary     |

✅ **Bottom Line:**  
Your pods **do not restart**.  
Only **control-plane downtime** occurs during renewal.

#### üéØ Logical Categories of Kubernetes Certificates

This document summarizes the main Kubernetes certificates, their categories, and how they depend on each other.

---

#### üü¢ 1Ô∏è‚É£ Cluster CA Certificates

These are **root certificates** that sign other certificates in the cluster.

##### ‚úÖ Cluster CA
- **File:** `ca.crt`
- **Signs:**
  - `apiserver.crt`
  - `apiserver-kubelet-client.crt`
  - `admin.conf`
  - `controller-manager.conf`
  - `scheduler.conf`

---

##### ‚úÖ etcd CA
- **File:** `etcd-ca.crt`
- **Signs:**
  - `etcd-server.crt`
  - `etcd-peer.crt`
  - `etcd-healthcheck-client.crt`
  - `apiserver-etcd-client.crt`

---

##### ‚úÖ Front-Proxy CA
- **File:** `front-proxy-ca.crt`
- **Signs:**
  - `front-proxy-client.crt`

> üìù These 3 CAs are **independent roots**, each responsible for a different part of the system.

---

#### üü° 2Ô∏è‚É£ API Server Certificates

Used for securing API server traffic.

- `apiserver.crt` ‚Äì serves HTTPS for API server
- `apiserver-kubelet-client.crt` ‚Äì used by API server to authenticate to kubelet
- `apiserver-etcd-client.crt` ‚Äì used by API server to authenticate to etcd

**Dependencies:**
- `apiserver.crt` depends on `ca.crt`
- `apiserver-kubelet-client.crt` depends on `ca.crt`
- `apiserver-etcd-client.crt` depends on `etcd-ca.crt`

---

#### üü£ 3Ô∏è‚É£ etcd Certificates

Used internally by etcd cluster nodes.

- `etcd-server.crt`
- `etcd-peer.crt`
- `etcd-healthcheck-client.crt`

**Dependency:**
- All signed by `etcd-ca.crt`

---

#### üîµ 4Ô∏è‚É£ Client Kubeconfigs

Certificates embedded in kubeconfigs for admins and controllers.

- `admin.conf`
- `controller-manager.conf`
- `scheduler.conf`

**Dependency:**
- All signed by `ca.crt`

---

#### üü† 5Ô∏è‚É£ Front Proxy Certificates

Used by the API aggregation layer.

- `front-proxy-client.crt`

**Dependency:**
- Signed by `front-proxy-ca.crt`


---

#### ‚è∞ How to check certificates expiration

```bash
kubeadm certs check-expiration
```

Shows expiration of all certs and residual time remaining.

```sh
root@prod-k8-master-node:~# kubeadm certs check-expiration
[check-expiration] Reading configuration from the cluster...
[check-expiration] FYI: You can look at this config file with 'kubectl -n kube-system get cm kubeadm-config -o yaml'

#### ‚úÖ Renewing Certificates Safely

##### 1. Renew All Component Certificates

```bash
sudo kubeadm certs renew all
```

- Uses existing CA
- Generates new certs with new expiry (default: 1 year)

##### 2. Restart Relevant Components

```bash
sudo systemctl restart kubelet
```

For static pods (control plane):

```bash
docker ps | grep kube-apiserver
# or
crictl ps | grep kube
```

Restart those containers if needed.

---

#### üõ° Renewing the CA Certificates (Advanced)

##### ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning:

Renewing the CA (`ca.crt`) will invalidate all existing component certs unless you use the **same key**.

##### 1. Backup first

```bash
cp -r /etc/kubernetes/pki /etc/kubernetes/pki-backup-$(date +%F)
```

##### 2. Renew CA

```bash
sudo kubeadm certs renew ca --use-api=false
```

Also for others:

```bash
sudo kubeadm certs renew etcd-ca --use-api=false
sudo kubeadm certs renew front-proxy-ca --use-api=false
```

##### 3. Optionally renew components to match new CA expiry

```bash
sudo kubeadm certs renew all
```

---

##### üîÅ If All Certs (Including CA) Expire

| Scenario                    | Impact                        |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Only component certs expire | API access issues, fixable    |
| CA certs expire             | Cluster breaks, kubelet fails |
| Both expire                 | Full outage, manual recovery  |

##### Recovery Plan

- Restore backup of `/etc/kubernetes/pki`
- Or: Recreate CA using OpenSSL + sign new certs manually
- Restart `kubelet` and relevant static pods

---

##### üß† Best Practices

- ‚úÖ Rotate certs **before** expiry
- ‚úÖ Keep regular backup of `/etc/kubernetes/pki`
- ‚úÖ Monitor using cron or Prometheus alerts
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Avoid extending component certs to 10 years unless you have a specific reason

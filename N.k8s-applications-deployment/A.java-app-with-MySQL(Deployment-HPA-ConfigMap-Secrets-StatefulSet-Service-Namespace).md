In this guide, 

You will practically use the following key Kubernetes objects. 

It will help you understand how these objects can be used in real-world project implementations:

- Deployment
- HPA
- ConfigMap
- Secrets
- StatefulSet
- Service
- Namespace

It also covers key concepts such as:

- Startup, readiness, and liveness probes
- Consuming secret and configmap data using Environment Variables
- MySQL initialization script from ConfigMap to create tables
- Creating an application properties file from ConfigMap to be consumed by the app

Additionally, you will go through:

- Building a Java Spring Boot application using Maven
- Dockerizing the Java application and pushing it to Docker Hub

This is a simple but effective project to put your basics into practice.

If you learn to work with one app effectively, you can deploy any number of apps.

It's all about understanding how to use these objects correctly, and this guide is a good starting point for that.

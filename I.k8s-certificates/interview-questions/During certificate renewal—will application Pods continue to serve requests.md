## **During Kubernetes Certificate Renewal, will application pods continue to serve requests?**

### ‚úÖ Short Answer

‚úÖ **Yes.**  
Running application pods (workloads) will **continue serving external traffic** during certificate renewal.

---

### üü¢ Why?

When you renew Kubernetes certificates (component certs or even CA certs), you are only affecting the **control plane** components:

- kube-apiserver
- kube-scheduler
- kube-controller-manager

However:

- **Kubelet does not stop running pods on your nodes.**
- **Container runtimes (containerd, Docker) keep all pods running.**
- **Kube-proxy and Service IPs continue routing traffic.**
- **Ingress controllers (nginx, Traefik) and LoadBalancers keep forwarding requests.**
- **Application containers have no awareness that certificates were changed.**

‚úÖ **Therefore, workloads stay online.**

---

### ‚úÖ What Does This Mean in Practice?

**While you rotate or renew certificates:**

- External users can still connect to your applications.
- Pods can continue to:
  - Receive HTTP requests
  - Reply to clients
  - Write to databases
  - Serve web traffic

**This includes:**

- Services with `ClusterIP`
- `NodePort` / `LoadBalancer`
- Ingress endpoints

‚úÖ **Everything continues working.**

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Exceptions / Caveats

The only time this is different is if:

üî∏ **Workloads depend on live API calls**
- Kubernetes client libraries continuously watching resources (e.g., Operators)
- Examples:
  - ArgoCD
  - Flux
  - cert-manager
  - Helm controllers
- These may temporarily fail or log errors while the API is restarting.

üî∏ **Pods with liveness/readiness probes querying the API server**
- During API server restart, probes can fail.
- Misconfigured probes without proper timeouts can trigger container restarts.

‚úÖ **However, for most applications serving HTTP/S or TCP connections:**
- No impact
- No restarts
- No loss of inbound connections

---

### ‚úÖ Real-World Clusters

Many production clusters:

- **Renew component certificates or CA certificates with the same private key in-place.**
- Plan a **short control-plane restart (seconds) in low-traffic windows.**
- Confirm workloads continue serving requests without disruption.

---

### ‚ú® Bottom Line

‚úÖ **Your application pods and workloads WILL CONTINUE to receive and respond to external requests during cert renewal.**  
‚úÖ **Only control-plane functions (kubectl access, new scheduling) briefly pause.**

## üí° Tip for Testing

If you want to be 100% sure:

1. Deploy a test workload in a staging cluster.
2. Start `watch curl` from an external machine.
3. Rotate certificates.
4. Observe uninterrupted responses.

# ‚öñÔ∏è Should Frontend Connect to Backend via Ingress Rules or via Codebase (Direct Service Calls)?

## üß© 1Ô∏è‚É£ The Two Options

### Option A ‚Äî Frontend ‚Üí Backend via Ingress

Your frontend (browser or SPA) calls the backend through a publicly exposed Ingress endpoint.

**Example:**

```
frontend: https://portal.company.com
backend:  https://api.company.com
```

Both are managed through Ingress rules, possibly behind the same NGINX Ingress Controller.

üß† In this case, traffic leaves the client (browser) and goes through the **Ingress Controller ‚Üí backend Service ‚Üí Pod**.

---

### Option B ‚Äî Frontend ‚Üí Backend via Cluster Internal Service (Codebase)

The frontend and backend talk directly inside the cluster (e.g., via Service DNS):

```
backend URL = http://backend-service:8080
```

The frontend Pod calls the backend Service directly using **Kubernetes DNS resolution** ‚Äî
no external Ingress or LoadBalancer involved.

## üèóÔ∏è 2Ô∏è‚É£ Which One to Use? (By Use Case)

| Environment | Recommended Approach | Why |
|--------------|----------------------|-----|
| Production (User-Facing Web App) | ‚úÖ Ingress-based communication | Keeps frontend and backend properly separated; allows HTTPS, domain-based routing, and TLS termination. |
| Internal Microservices Communication | ‚úÖ Service-to-Service (codebase) | Faster, secure, and internal-only communication; no need for external routing. |
| Hybrid / API Gateway setup | ‚úÖ Ingress ‚Üí API Gateway ‚Üí Internal Services | Best for microservice architecture with API versioning, security, and rate limiting. |

## üß≠ 3Ô∏è‚É£ Real-World Production Example

Frontend (React / Angular) hosted via `frontend-ui` Service  
Backend (Spring Boot / Node.js) via `backend-api` Service

**Ingress setup:**

```yaml
rules:
- host: portal.company.com
  http:
    paths:
    - path: /
      pathType: Prefix
      backend:
        service:
          name: frontend-ui
          port:
            number: 80
- host: api.company.com
  http:
    paths:
    - path: /v1/
      pathType: Prefix
      backend:
        service:
          name: backend-api
          port:
            number: 8080
```

**Frontend code:**

```javascript
fetch('https://api.company.com/v1/login', {
  method: 'POST',
  body: JSON.stringify(credentials)
});
```

‚úÖ **Good because:**

- Both frontend and backend are served via Ingress (secured with HTTPS).  
- Separation of concern ‚Äî frontend never directly hits cluster IPs.  
- Works well behind CDN, WAF, or API Gateway.

## üö´ 4Ô∏è‚É£ What You Should Not Do

| Mistake | Why It‚Äôs Bad |
|----------|---------------|
| Hardcode backend Pod IPs or NodePorts in frontend | Pods are ephemeral ‚Äî IPs change |
| Expose backend Service via NodePort unnecessarily | Security risk and non-portable |
| Call internal service (http://backend-service:8080) from frontend JavaScript in browser | That hostname is not resolvable from the user's browser; works only inside the cluster |

---

## üß† 5Ô∏è‚É£ Best Practice Summary

| Scenario | Recommended Approach |
|-----------|----------------------|
| Frontend (Browser / SPA) ‚Üí Backend | Ingress Rules (Domain-based routing, HTTPS, CORS, load balancing) |
| Backend ‚Üí Backend (microservices) | Service DNS (ClusterIP) communication |
| API Gateway architecture | Ingress ‚Üí Gateway (e.g., Kong, Istio, Traefik) ‚Üí Services |
| Dev / local cluster | Can use kubectl port-forward for testing |

---

## ‚úÖ Final Answer

üí° **Best practice:**

- Use **Ingress rules** for frontend ‚Üí backend communication (browser to API).  
- Use **Service-to-Service (ClusterIP)** communication for internal microservices.  

That ensures **security, scalability, and proper separation** between public and internal traffic.

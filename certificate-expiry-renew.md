#### üìå Certificate Types in Kubernetes

| Certificate                    | Purpose                                             | Signed By        | Default Validity |
| ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------- | ---------------- | ---------------- |
| `ca.crt`                       | Cluster Certificate Authority                       | Self-signed      | 10 years         |
| `etcd-ca.crt`                  | CA for etcd-related certificates                    | Self-signed      | 10 years         |
| `front-proxy-ca.crt`           | CA for front proxy communication                    | Self-signed      | 10 years         |

#### ‚è∞ How to check certificates expiration

```bash
kubeadm certs check-expiration
```

Shows expiration of all certs and residual time remaining.

```sh
root@prod-k8-master-node:~# kubeadm certs check-expiration
[check-expiration] Reading configuration from the cluster...
[check-expiration] FYI: You can look at this config file with 'kubectl -n kube-system get cm kubeadm-config -o yaml'

#### ‚úÖ Renewing Certificates Safely

##### 1. Renew All Component Certificates

```bash
sudo kubeadm certs renew all
```

- Uses existing CA
- Generates new certs with new expiry (default: 1 year)

##### 2. Restart Relevant Components

```bash
sudo systemctl restart kubelet
```

For static pods (control plane):

```bash
docker ps | grep kube-apiserver
# or
crictl ps | grep kube
```

Restart those containers if needed.

---

#### üõ° Renewing the CA Certificates (Advanced)

##### ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning:

Renewing the CA (`ca.crt`) will invalidate all existing component certs unless you use the **same key**.

##### 1. Backup first

```bash
cp -r /etc/kubernetes/pki /etc/kubernetes/pki-backup-$(date +%F)
```

##### 2. Renew CA

```bash
sudo kubeadm certs renew ca --use-api=false
```

Also for others:

```bash
sudo kubeadm certs renew etcd-ca --use-api=false
sudo kubeadm certs renew front-proxy-ca --use-api=false
```

##### 3. Optionally renew components to match new CA expiry

```bash
sudo kubeadm certs renew all
```

---

##### üîÅ If All Certs (Including CA) Expire

| Scenario                    | Impact                        |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Only component certs expire | API access issues, fixable    |
| CA certs expire             | Cluster breaks, kubelet fails |
| Both expire                 | Full outage, manual recovery  |

##### Recovery Plan

- Restore backup of `/etc/kubernetes/pki`
- Or: Recreate CA using OpenSSL + sign new certs manually
- Restart `kubelet` and relevant static pods

---

##### üß† Best Practices

- ‚úÖ Rotate certs **before** expiry
- ‚úÖ Keep regular backup of `/etc/kubernetes/pki`
- ‚úÖ Monitor using cron or Prometheus alerts
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Avoid extending component certs to 10 years unless you have a specific reason
